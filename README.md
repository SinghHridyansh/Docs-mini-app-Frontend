## Description

I would like to explain this project as a Dummy Docs Management Application. The main purpose of developing this application was to learn the proper implementation of Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion Library. In the application the dummy tasks are present in the form of cards that can be dragged when selected. On the basis of the tag status, the card depicts different dummy information and styling.
